# Evolutionary-Robotics
I successfully bridged the Reality Gap in Evolutionary Robotics - evolving a neural network controller to exhibit an arbitrary behaviour within a simulation, before transferring that controller in to a real robot, seeing a 41-thousand fold improvement in the time required versus a locally evolved controller. I achieved a more robust transfer through the incorporation of noise within the simulation during the evolutionary phase to mirror the non idealistic conditions of the real world.

This project achieved a 1st as the dissertation for my undergraduate degree in Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence

Please note the original implementation of CMA-ES used was developed by Yarpiz.
